  abstract = {Varying the spatial distribution of applied nitrogen (N) fertilizer to match demand in crops has been shown to increase profits in Australia. Better matching the timing of N inputs to plant requirements has been shown to improve nitrogen use efficiency and crop yields and could reduce nitrous oxide emissions from broad acre grains. Farmers in the wheat production area of south eastern Australia are increasingly splitting N application with the second timing applied at stem elongation (Zadoks 30). Spectral indices have shown the ability to detect crop canopy N status but a robust method using a consistent calibration that functions across seasons has been lacking. One spectral index, the canopy chlorophyll content index (CCCI) designed to detect canopy N using three wavebands along the ``red edge'' of the spectrum was combined with the canopy nitrogen index (CNI), which was developed to normalize for crop biomass and correct for the N dilution effect of crop canopies. The CCCI\textendash{}CNI index approach was applied to a 3-year study to develop a single calibration derived from a wheat crop sown in research plots near Horsham, Victoria, Australia. The index was able to predict canopy N (g m-2) from Zadoks 14\textendash{}37 with an r2 of 0.97 and RMSE of 0.65 g N m-2 when dry weight biomass by area was also considered. We suggest that measures of N estimated from remote methods use N per unit area as the metric and that reference directly to canopy \%N is not an appropriate method for estimating plant concentration without first accounting for the N dilution effect. This approach provides a link to crop development rather than creating a purely numerical relationship. The sole biophysical input, biomass, is challenging to quantify robustly via spectral methods. Combining remote sensing with crop modelling could provide a robust method for estimating biomass and therefore a method to estimate canopy N remotely. Future research will explore this and the use of active and passive sensor technologies for use in precision farming for targeted N management.},

  abstract = {Variable-rate technologies and site-specific crop nutrient management require real-time spatial information about the potential for response to in-season crop management interventions. Thermal and spectral properties of canopies can provide relevant information for non-destructive measurement of crop water and nitrogen stresses. In previous studies, foliage temperature was successfully estimated from canopy-scale (mixed foliage and soil) temperatures and the multispectral Canopy Chlorophyll Content Index (CCCI) was effective in measuring canopy-scale N status in rainfed wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) systems in Horsham, Victoria, Australia. In the present study, results showed that under irrigated wheat systems in Maricopa, Arizona, USA, the theoretical derivation of foliage temperature unmixing produced relationships similar to those in Horsham. Derivation of the CCCI led to an r2 relationship with chlorophyll a of 0.53 after Zadoks stage 43. This was later than the relationship (r2 = 0.68) developed for Horsham after Zadoks stage 33 but early enough to be used for potential mid-season N fertilizer recommendations. Additionally, ground-based hyperspectral data estimated plant N (g kg-1) in Horsham with an r2 = 0.86 but was confounded by water supply and N interactions. By combining canopy thermal and spectral properties, varying water and N status can potentially be identified eventually permitting targeted N applications to those parts of a field where N can be used most efficiently by the crop.},

It covers the VNIR/SWIR spectral region in 13 bands and incorporates two new spectral bands in the red-edge region, which can be used to derive vegetation indices using red-edge bands in their formulation. These are particularly suitable for estimating canopy chlorophyll and nitrogen (N) content. This band setting is important for vegetation studies and is very similar to the ones of the Ocean and Land Colour Instrument (OLCI) on the planned Sentinel-3 satellite and the Medium Resolution Imaging Spectrometer (MERIS) on Envisat, which operated from 2002 to early 2012. This paper focuses on the potential of Sentinel-2 and Sentinel-3 in estimating total crop and grass chlorophyll and N content by studying in situ crop variables and spectroradiometer measurements obtained for four different test sites. In particular, the red-edge chlorophyll index (CIred-edge), the green chlorophyll index (CIgreen) and the MERIS terrestrial chlorophyll index (MTCI) were found to be accurate and linear estimators of canopy chlorophyll and N content and the Sentinel-2 and -3 bands are well positioned for deriving these indices. Results confirm the importance of the red-edge bands on particularly Sentinel-2 for agricultural applications, because of the combination with its high spatial resolution of 20 m.},

  abstract = {ESA's upcoming satellite Sentinel-2 will provide Earth images of high spatial, spectral and temporal resolution and aims to ensure continuity for Landsat and SPOT observations. In comparison to the latter sensors, Sentinel-2 incorporates three new spectral bands in the red-edge region, which are centered at 705, 740 and 783 nm. This study addresses the importance of these new bands for the retrieval and monitoring of two important biophysical parameters: green leaf area index (LAI) and chlorophyll content (Ch). With data from several ESA field campaigns over agricultural sites (SPARC, AgriSAR, CEFLES2) we have evaluated the efficacy of two empirical methods that specifically make use of the new Sentinel-2 bands. First, it was shown that LAI can be derived from a generic normalized difference index (NDI) using hyperspectral data, with 674 nm with 712 nm as best performing bands. These bands are positioned closely to the Sentinel-2 B4 (665 nm) and the new red-edge B5 (705 nm) band. The method has been applied to simulated Sentinel-2 data. The resulting green LAI map was validated against field data of various crop types, thereby spanning a LAI between 0 and 6, and yielded a RMSE of 0.6. Second, the recently developed "Normalized Area Over reflectance Curve" (NAOC), an index that derives Ch from hyperspectral data, was studied on its compatibility with simulated Sentinel-2 data. This index integrates the reflectance curve between 643 and 795 nm, thereby including the new Sentinel-2 bands in the red-edge region. We found that these new bands significantly improve the accuracy of Ch estimation. Both methods emphasize the importance of red-edge bands for operational estimation of biophysical parameters from Sentinel-2.},

A nitrogen stress index was developed, which adjusts shoot \%N for plant biomass and area, thereby accounting for environmental conditions that affect growth, such as crop water status. The canopy chlorophyll content index (CCCi) and the modified spectral ratio planar index (mSRPi) could explain 68 and 69\% of the observed variability in the nitrogen nutrition of the crop as early as Zadoks 33, irrespective of water status or ground cover. The CCCi was derived from the combination of 3 wavebands 670, 720 and 790 nm, and the mSRPi from 445, 705 and 750 nm, together with broader bands in the NIR and RED.

  abstract = {Real-time, nondestructive monitoring of crop nitrogen (N) status is important for precise N management in winter wheat production. Nadir viewing passive multispectral sensors have limited utility for measuring the N status of winter wheat in middle and bottom layers, and multi-angular remote sensors may instead improve detection of whole canopy physiological and biochemical parameters. Our objective was to improve the predictive accuracy and angular stability of leaf nitrogen concentration (LNC) measurement by constructing a novel Angular Insensitivity Vegetation Index (AIVI). We quantified the relationship between LNC and ground-based multi-angular hyperspectral reflectance in winter wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) across different growth stages, plant types, N rates, planting density, ecological sites and years. The optimum vegetation indices (VIs) obtained from 17 traditional indices reported in the literature were tested for their stability in estimating LNC at 13 view zenith angles (VZAs) in the solar principal plane (SPP). Overall the back-scatter direction gave improved index performance, relative to the nadir and forward-scattering direction. Red-edge VIs (e.g., mND705, GND [750,550], NDRE, RI-1dB) were highly correlated with LNC. However, the relationships strongly depended on experimental conditions, and these VIs tended to saturate at the highest LNC (4.5\%). To further overcome the influence of different experimental conditions and VZAs on VIs, we developed a novel index, Angular Insensitivity Vegetation Index (AIVI), based on red-edge, blue and green bands. Our new model showed the highest association with LNC (R2 = 0.73\textendash{}0.87) compared to traditional VIs. Investigating AIVI predictive accuracy in measuring LNC across view zenith angles (VZAs) revealed that performance was the highest at - 20$^\circ$ and was relatively homogenous between - 10$^\circ$ and - 40$^\circ$. This provided a united, predictive model across this wide-angle range, which enhances the possibility of N monitoring by using portable monitors. Testing of the models with independent data gave R2 of 0.84 at - 20$^\circ$, and 0.83 across the range of - 10$^\circ$ to - 40$^\circ$, respectively. These results suggest that the novel AIVI is more effective for monitoring LNC than previously reported VIs for predicting accuracy, monitoring model stability and view angle independency. More generally, our model indicates the importance of accounting for angular effects when analyzing VIs under different experimental conditions.},

  abstract = {In recent decades, many spectral indices have been proposed to estimate crop nitrogen (N) status parameters. However, most of the indices based on red radiation lose their sensitivity under high aboveground biomass conditions. The objectives of this study were to (i) evaluate red-edge based spectral indices for estimating plant N concentration and uptake of summer maize (Zea mays L.) and (ii) study the influence of bandwidth and crop growth stage changes on the performance of various vegetation indices. Nitrogen rate experiments for maize were conducted in 2009 and 2010 at Quzhou Experimental Station of China Agricultural University in the North China Plain. The spectral indices were calculated from hyperspectral narrow bands, simulated Crop Circle ACS-470 active crop canopy sensor bands and simulated WorldView-2 satellite broad bands. The results indicated that red edge-based canopy chlorophyll content index (CCCI) performed the best across different bandwidths for estimating summer maize plant N concentration and uptake at the V6 and V7 and V10\textendash{}V12 stages. The second best index was MERIS terrestrial chlorophyll index (MTCI). The four red edge-based indices, CCCI, MTCI, normalized difference red edge (NDRE) and red edge chlorophyll index (CIred edge), performed similarly better across bandwidths for estimating plant N uptake (R2 = 0.76\textendash{}0.91) than normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) and ratio vegetation index (RVI) (R2 = 0.54\textendash{}0.80) at the V10\textendash{}V12 and V6\textendash{}V12 stages. More studies are needed to further evaluate these red edge-based vegetation indices using real Crop Circle ACS 470 sensor and satellite remote sensing images for maize as well as other crops under on-farm conditions.},

This paper presents an analysis of spatial co-registration accuracy for several datasets of Sentinel-2 and Landsat 8 images distributed all around the world. Images were compared with digital correlation techniques for image matching, obtaining an evaluation of registration accuracy with an affine transformation as geometrical model.

Measurements of surface reflectance in narrow visible and near-infrared wavelengths have potential for monitoring crop photosynthesis and fluorescence. Surface reflectances in wide bands of the visible, near-IR, and short-wave IR spectrum have been used to detect plant manifestations of chronic crop water stress, such as phenological adaptations and leaf expansion and loss.

The AHS sensor was flown at 7:30, 9:30 and 12:30 GMT in 25 July 2004 over an olive orchard with three different water-deficit irrigation treatments to study the spatial and diurnal variability of temperature as a function of water stress. A total of 10 AHS bands located within the thermal-infrared region were assessed for the retrieval of the land surface temperature using the split-window algorithm, separating pure crowns from shadows and sunlit soil pixels using the reflectance bands. Ground truth validation was conducted with infrared thermal sensors placed on top of the trees for continuous thermal data acquisition. Crown temperature (Tc), crown minus air temperature (Tc - Ta), and relative temperature difference to well-irrigated trees (Tc - TR, where TR is the mean temperature of the well-irrigated trees) were calculated from the ground sensors and from the AHS imagery at the crown spatial resolution. Correlation coefficients for Tc - TR between ground IRT sensors and airborne image-based AHS estimations were R2 = 0.50 (7:30 GMT), R2 = 0.45 (9:30 GMT) and R2 = 0.57 (12:30 GMT). Relationships between leaf water potential and crown Tc - Ta measured with the airborne sensor obtained determination coefficients of R2 = 0.62 (7:30 GMT), R2 = 0.35 (9:30 GMT) and R2 = 0.25 (12:30 GMT).

To this end, the objective of this paper has been to present new added-value tools first through the integration of different satellite platforms: data from NASA Landsat-8 and ESA Sentinel-1 have been used and combined, and furthermore through the comparison of satellite data all from the same Copernicus project: data from Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 have been jointly processed and compared. Although data from optical/multispectral sensors, as those of Landsat-8 and Sentinel-2, and data from SAR on board of Sentinel-1, are very different, their combination provides useful and interesting results. The integration and combination of these data can find useful application in many fields from oceans to waterways, from land surfaces to fossil deposits, from vegetation to forest areas. In this works authors have focused their interest in green areas and vegetation monitoring applications, by choosing as case of interest the Royal Palace of Caserta and its gardens. The idea has started from the increasing interest in monitoring the cultural heritage monuments and in particular the surrounding vegetation with the green areas and the parks inside. Satellite images can put into evidence boundaries modifications, the vegetation state, their possible degradation, and other phenomena such as changes in the territories due both to natural and to anthropogenic causes. Data combination from different sources as above specified gives a good number of indexes very useful to analyze the vegetation state and its health in a very deep way. Many of these indexes have been calculated and discussed for investigation. \textcopyright{} 2016 IMEKO.},

  abstract = {Among the environmental factors that can be modified by farmers, water and nitrogen are the main ones controlling plant growth. Irrigation and fertilizer application overcome this effect, if adequately used. Agriculture thus consumes about 85\% of the total fresh water used worldwide. While only 18\% of the world's cultivated areas are devoted to irrigated agriculture, this total surface represents more than 45\% of total agricultural production. These data highlight the importance of irrigated agriculture in a framework where the growing population demands greater food production. In addition, tighter water restrictions and competition with other sectors of society is increasing pressure to diminish the share of fresh water for irrigation, thus resulting in the decrease in water diverted for agriculture.The effect of water and nutrient application on yield has led to the overuse of these practices in the last decades. This misuse of irrigation and fertilizers is no longer sustainable, given the economic and environmental costs. Sustainable agriculture requires a correct balance between the agronomic, economic and environmental aspects of nutrient management. The major advances shown in this review are the following: (1) the measurement of the intensity of drought and N deficiency is a prerequisite for quantitative assessment of crop needs and management of both irrigation and fertilizer application. The N concentration of leaves exposed to direct irradiance allows both a reliable and high-resolution measurement of the status and the assessment of N nutrition at the plant level. (2) Two experiments on sunflower and on tall fescue are used to relate the changes in time and irrigation intensity to the crop N status, and to introduce the complex relationships between N demand and supply in crops. (3) Effects of water deficits on N demand are reviewed, pointing out the high sensitivity of N-rich organs versus the relative lesser sensitivity of organs that are poorer in N compounds. (4) The generally equal sensitivities of nitrifying and denitrifying microbes are likely to explain many conflicting results on the impact of water deficits on soil mineral N availability for crops. (5) The transpiration stream largely determines the availability of mineral N in the rhizosphere. This makes our poor estimate of root densities a major obstacle to any precise assessment of N availability in fertilized crops. (6) The mineral N fluxes in the xylem are generally reduced under water deficit and assimilation is generally known to be more sensitive to water scarcity. (7) High osmotic pressures are maintained during grain filling, which enables the plant to recycle large amounts of previously assimilated N. Its part in the total grain N yield is therefore generally higher under water deficits. (8) Most crop models currently used in agronomy use N and water efficiently but exhibit different views on their interaction.},

  abstract = {Water and nutrients exist together in close association because plant-available nutrient ions are dissolved in the soil solution and nutrient uptake by grapevines depends on water flow through the soil-root-shoot pathway. Leaf transpiration generates the tension necessary for the roots to absorb this essential solution, but in a drying soil, uptake of water and nutrients becomes progressively more difficult for grapevines. In addition, application of nitrogen fertilizer can increase the vine's susceptibility to drought, because nitrogen favors shoot growth over root growth. However, because growth is more sensitive than photosynthesis to both water and nitrogen shortage, deficit irrigation may be used in conjunction with limited nitrogen application to control canopy development, yield, and fruit composition. Growth is the ``pacemaker'' for nutrient uptake by the vine, hence the growth reduction induced by water deficit also decreases vine nutrient requirements. Nevertheless, reducing water or nitrogen supply can be perceived as a stress by the vine, and its response depends on developmental status. For instance, water deficit applied before fruit set may reduce cluster and berry numbers, especially if combined with nitrogen shortage. Properly regulated deficit irrigation in combination with low to moderate rates of nitrogen application between bloom and veraison reduces canopy size, berry size, and yield, accelerates ripening, improves fruit color, and reduces disease incidence. However, this strategy also reduces yeast-assimilable nitrogen in the fruit, thereby increasing the risk of sluggish or stuck fermentation. Moreover, if the water or nitrogen deficit becomes too severe, fruit quality suffers from both limited assimilate supply and excessive fruit exposure to sunlight. The relationship between vine nutrition and deficit irrigation clearly requires careful guidance to make it a happy one.},

  abstract = {Effects of leaf age, nitrogen nutrition and photon flux density (PFD) on the distribution of nitrogen among leaves were investigated in a vine, Ipomoea tricolor Cav., which had been grown horizontally so as to avoid mutual shading of leaves. The nitrogen content was highest in newly developed young leaves and decreased with age of leaves in plants grown at low nitrate concentrations and with all leaves exposed to full sunlight. Thus, a distinct gradient of leaf nitrogen content was formed along the gradient of leaf age. However, no gradient of leaf nitrogen content was formed in plants grown at a high nitrate concentration. Effects of PFD on the distribution of nitrogen were examined by shading leaves in a manner that simulated changes in the light gradient of an erect herbaceous canopy (i.e., where old leaves were placed under increasingly darker conditions with growth of the canopy). This canopy-type shading steepened the gradient of leaf nitrogen content in plants grown at a low nitrogen supply, and created a gradient in plants grown at high concentrations of nitrate. The steeper the gradient of PFD, the larger the gradient of leaf nitrogen that was formed. When the gradient of shading was inverted, that is, younger leaves were subjected to increasingly heavier shade, while keeping the oldest leaves exposed to full sunlight, an inverted gradient of leaf nitrogen content was formed at high nitrate concentrations. The gradient of leaf nitrogen content generated either by advance of leaf age at low nitrogen availability, or by canopy-type shading, was comparable to those reported for the canopies of erect herbaceous plants. It is concluded that both leaf age and PFD have potential to cause the non-uniform distribution of leaf nitrogen. It is also shown that the contribution of leaf age increases with the decrease in nitrogen nutrition level.},

  issn = {0305-7364},
  abstract = {A set of N-fertilization field experiments was used to determine the 'critical nitrogen concentration', i.e. the minimal concentration of total N in shoots that produced the maximum aerial dry matter, at a given time and field situation. A unique 'critical nitrogen dilution curve' was obtained by plotting these concentrations Nct (\% DM) vs. accumulated shoot biomass DM (t ha⁻$^1$). It could be described by the equation: Nct = 5$\cdot$35DM⁰$\cdot$⁴⁴$^2$ when shoot biomass was between 1$\cdot$55 and 12 t ha⁻$^1$. An excellent fit was obtained between model and data (r$^2$ = 0$\cdot$98, 15 d.f.). A very close relationship was found using reduced N instead of total N, because the nitrate concentrations in shoots corresponding to critical points were small. The critical curve was rather close to those reported by Greenwood et al. (1990) for C₃ plants. However, this equation did not apply when shoot biomass was less than 1$\cdot$55 t ha⁻$^1$. In this case, the critical N concentration was independent of shoot biomass: the constant critical value Ncr = 4$\cdot$4\% is suggested for reduced-N. The model was validated in all the experimental situations, in spite of large differences in growth rate, cultivar, soil and climatic conditions; shoot biomass varying from 0$\cdot$2 to 14 t ha⁻$^1$. Plant N concentration was found to vary by a factor of four at a given shoot biomass level. In the heavily fertilized treatments, shoot N concentration could be 60\% higher than the critical concentration. Most (on average 80\%) of the extra N accumulated was in the form of reduced N. The proportion of nitrate to total N in shoot mainly depended on the crop stage of development. It was independent of the nitrogen nutrition level.},

Four field experiments, using varied N fertilizer rates (0\textendash{}375 kg ha-1) and six cultivars (Yangmai16, Ningmai13, Ningmai9, Aikang58, Yangmai12, Huaimai 17), were conducted in the Jiangsu province of eastern China. Twenty plants from each plot were sampled to determine the SDM and spike N concentration (SNC) during the reproductive growth period. The spike Nc curve was described by Nc = 2.85\texttimes{}SDM-0.17, with SDM ranging from 0.752 to 7.233 t ha-1. The newly developed curve was lower than the Nc curve based on plant DM. The N nutrition index (NNI) for spike dry matter ranged from 0.62 to 1.1 during the reproductive growth period across the seasons. Relative yield (RY) increased with increasing NNI; however, when NNI was greater than 0.96, RY plateaued and remained stable. The spike Nc dilution curve can be used to correctly identify the N nutrition status of winter wheat to support N management during the reproductive growth period for winter wheat in eastern China.},

  doi = {10.1007/BF00377192},
  abstract = {SummaryThe photosynthetic capacity of leaves is related to the nitrogen content primarily bacause the proteins of the Calvin cycle and thylakoids represent the majority of leaf nitrogen. To a first approximation, thylakoid nitrogen is proportional to the chlorophyll content (50 mol thylakoid N mol-1 Chl). Within species there are strong linear relationships between nitrogen and both RuBP carboxylase and chlorophyll. With increasing nitrogen per unit leaf area, the proportion of total leaf nitrogen in the thylakoids remains the same while the proportion in soluble protein increases. In many species, growth under lower irradiance greatly increases the partitioning of nitrogen into chlorophyll and the thylakoids, while the electron transport capacity per unit of chlorophyll declines. If growth irradiance influences the relationship between photosynthetic capacity and nitrogen content, predicting nitrogen distribution between leaves in a canopy becomes more complicated. When both photosynthetic capacity and leaf nitrogen content are expressed on the basis of leaf area, considerable variation in the photosynthetic capacity for a given leaf nitrogen content is found between species. The variation reflects different strategies of nitrogen partitioning, the electron transport capacity per unit of chlorophyll and the specific activity of RuBP carboxylase. Survival in certain environments clearly does not require maximising photosynthetic capacity for a given leaf nitrogen content. Species that flourish in the shade partition relatively more nitrogen into the thylakoids, although this is associated with lower photosynthetic capacity per unit of nitrogen.},

  abstract = {The direct estimation of nitrogen (N) in fresh vegetation is challenging due to its weak influence on leaf reflectance and the overlaps with absorption features of other compounds. Different empirical models relate in this work leaf nitrogen concentration ([N]Leaf) on Holm oak to leaf reflectance as well as derived spectral indices such as normalized difference indices (NDIs), the three bands indices (TBIs) and indices previously used to predict leaf N and chlorophyll. The models were calibrated and assessed their accuracy, robustness and the strength of relationship when other biochemicals were considered. Red edge was the spectral region most strongly correlated with [N]Leaf, whereas most of the published spectral indexes did not provide accurate estimations. NDIs and TBIs based models could achieve robust and acceptable accuracies (TBI1310,1720,730: R2 = 0.76, [0.64,0.86]; RMSE (\%) = 9.36, [7.04,12.83]). These models sometimes included indices with bands close to absorption features of N bonds or nitrogenous compounds, but also of other biochemicals. Models were independently and inter-annually validated using the bootstrap method, which allowed discarding those models non-robust across different years. Partial correlation analysis revealed that spectral estimators did not strongly respond to [N]Leaf but to other leaf variables such as chlorophyll and water, even if bands close to absorption features of N bonds or compounds were present in the models.},

A parameter $\lambda$re was defined as the wavelength of maximum slope and found to be dependent on chlorophyll concentration (p$<$0.001), with additional effects of species, developmental stage, leaf layering and leaf water content. The maximum slope parameter was found to be independent of simulated ground area coverage. Often two $\lambda$re components were identified and both showed a linear relationship with the chlorophyll content of the leaves. The results have been interpreted in terms of Beer's Law and Kubelka-Munk theory. The chlorophyll concentration dependence of $\lambda$re seems to be explained in terms of a pure absorption effect, and it is suggested that the existence of two $\lambda$re components arises from the additional factor of leaf scattering properties. In comparison to broad band reflectance, the results indicate that red edge measurements will be valuable for assessment of vegetative chlorophyll status and leaf area index independently of ground cover variations, and are particularly suitable for early stress detection.},

Consequently, Sentinel-2 will directly contribute to the Land Monitoring, Emergency Response, and Security services. The corresponding user requirements have driven the design toward a dependable multi-spectral Earth-observation system featuring the Multi Spectral Instrument (MSI) with 13 spectral bands spanning from the visible and the near infrared to the short wave infrared. The spatial resolution varies from 10 m to 60 m depending on the spectral band with a 290 km field of view. This unique combination of high spatial resolution, wide field of view and spectral coverage will represent a major step forward compared to current multi-spectral missions. The mission foresees a series of satellites, each having a 7.25-year lifetime over a 15-year period starting with the launch of Sentinel-2A foreseen in 2013. During full operations two identical satellites will be maintained in the same orbit with a phase delay of 180$^\circ$ providing a revisit time of five days at the equator. This paper provides an overview of the GMES Sentinel-2 mission including a technical system concept overview, image quality, Level 1 data processing and operational applications.},

  abstract = {Many vegetation indices have been developed for the estimation of green biomass over the last three decades. The Normalized Vegetation Index is the most well-known index; however, it has a saturation problem at moderate to high vegetation densities. The red-edge region (700-740nm) has been introduced to increase sensitivity at these moderate to high vegetation densities. We propose a new vegetation index for biomass estimation of short vegetation, to improve the saturation problem using the red-edge bands. By using the Hyper-spectral image data of Maize and Soybean, the nine well-known vegetation indices are evaluated and compared with the proposed index. For validation of the proposed model using Sentinel-2 data, Pereira allometric data is used (r-square is 0.765).},

  abstract = {Timely and accurate assessment of canopy nitrogen content (CNC) provides valuable insight into rapid and real-time nitrogen status monitoring in crops. A semi-empirical approach based on spectral index was extensively used for nitrogen content estimation. However, in many cases, due to specific vegetation types or local conditions, the applicability and robustness of established spectral indices for nitrogen retrieval were limited. The objective of this study was to investigate the optimal spectral index for winter wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) CNC estimation using Pushbroom Hyperspectral Imager (PHI) airborne hyperspectral data. Data collected from two different field experiments that were conducted during the major growth stages of winter wheat in 2002 and 2003 were used. Our results showed that a significant linear relationship existed between nitrogen and chlorophyll content at the canopy level, and it was not affected by cultivars, growing conditions and nutritional status of winter wheat. Nevertheless, it varied with growth stages. Periods around heading stage mainly worsened the relationship and CNC estimation, and CNC assessment for growth stages before and after heading could improve CNC retrieval accuracy to some extent. CNC assessment with PHI airborne hyperspectra suggested that spectral indices based on red-edge band including narrowband and broadband CIred-edge, NDVI-like and ND705 showed convincing results in CNC retrieval. NDVI-like and ND705 were sensitive to detect CNC changes less than 5 g/m2, narrowband and broadband CIred-edge were sensitive to a wide range of CNC variations. Further evaluation of CNC retrieval using field measured hyperspectra indicated that NDVI-like was robust and exhibited the highest accuracy in CNC assessment, and spectral indices (CIred-edge and CIgreen) that established on narrow or broad bands showed no obvious difference in CNC assessment. Overall, our study suggested that NDVI-like was the optimal indicator for winter wheat CNC retrieval.},

For cotton (Gossypium hirsutum L. var DPI-70) and range grass (Eragrosticslehmanniana Nees) canopies, underlain with different soil backgrounds, the transformation nearly eliminated soil-induced variations in vegetation indices.

  abstract = {Recent research has shown that general trends in forest leaf area index along regional climatic gradients can be adequately characterized by using ratios of near-infrared and red reflectances. However it has proven difficult to represent properly the spatial distribution of Leaf Area Index (LAI) at sub-regional scales such as small catchments. The key problem at Thematic Mapper scale is the variation in canopy closure and understorey contribution, which dramatically influences near-infrared reflectance from conifer forests, [n this paper, a new spectral index is presented to estimate LAI of conifer forests using a combination of Red, NIR and mid-IR reflectances from the Landsat Thematic Mapper (TM). A simulation system (RHESSys) was used first, to generate potential vegetation patterns around a watershed in order to test them against remotely-sensed vegetation patterns, and secondly, to test the sensitivity of forest ecosystem processes to LAT estimated from combinations of the Thematic Mapper data The relation between Normalised Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) and LAI is poorly defined at TM scale because of the outsized contribution of understorey vegetation and background materials to the NIR reflectance in open canopies. The mid-IR correction factor acting as a scalar for canopy closure scaled down the inflated NDVI in the open canopies, resulting in an improved relation between NDVI and LAT LAI, estimates from the MIR corrected NDVI better represented the vegetation patterns in Soup Creek watershed than those from uncorrected NDVI both in terms of magnitude and spatial patterns. Simulations using LAIs derived from corrected NDVI showed lower rates evapotranspiration and net photosynthesis. Differences in mean responses of evapotranspiration and photosynthesis were as large as 8cm and 2tonC ha-1 yr-1 respectively between simulation runs using LAIs from corrected and uncorrected NDVI.},

  abstract = {The goal of the study is to investigate the basic spectral properties of plant leaves to develop spectral indices more sensitive to chlorophyll concentration than the presently widely used Notmalized Difference Vegetation Index. These indices can serve as indicators of stress, senescence, and disease in higher plants. The spectral reflectance of senescing leaves of two deciduous species (maple and chestnut) as well as their pigment content were measured. Spectral indices were developed using reflectances corresponding to wavelengths with maximum and minimum sensitivity to variation in pigment concentration. The signature analysis of reflectance spectra indicated that, for a wide range of leaf greenness (completely yellow to dark green leaves), the maximum sensitivity of reflectance coincides with the maximum absorption of chlorophyll a at 670 nm. However, for yellow-green to green leaves (minimum chlorophyll a as low as 3-5 nmol/cm2), the reflectance near 670nm is not sensitive to chlorophyll concentration due to saturation effects. Therefore, it seems inappropriate to use this spectral band for pigment estimation in yellow-green to green vegetation. The spectral bands ranging from 400 to 480 nm and above 730 nm are not sensitive to chlorophyll concentration as found for 670 nm. The reflectances at these wavelengths could be used as references in the vegetation indices. Maximum sensitivity to chlorophyll a concentration was found at 550-560 nm and 700-710 nm. Reflectances at 700 nm correlated very well with that at 550 nm for a wide range of chlorophyll concentrations for both plant species studied. The inverse reflectance, R550)-1 and (R700)-1 are proportional to chlorophyll a concentration; therefore indices R750/R550 and R750/R700 are directly proportional (correlation r2 $>$ 0.95) to chlorophyll concentration. These indices were tested for a wide range of chlorophyll a concentration, using several independent data sets. The estimation error in the derivation of chlorophyll concentration from the indices is assessed to be less than 1.2 nmol/cm2.},

  abstract = {Leaf chlorophyll content provides valuable information about physiological status of plants. Reflectance measurement makes it possible to quickly and non-destructively assess, in situ, the chlorophyll content in leaves. Our objective was to investigate the spectral behavior of the relationship between reflectance and chlorophyll content and to develop a technique for non-destructive chlorophyll estimation in leaves with a wide range of pigment content and composition using reflectance in a few broad spectral bands. Spectral reflectance of maple, chestnut, wild vine and beech leaves in a wide range of pigment content and composition was investigated. It was shown that reciprocal reflectance (R$<$)-1 in the spectral range $\lambda$ from 520 to 550 nm and 695 to 705 nm related closely to the total chlorophyll content in leaves of all species. Subtraction of near infra-red reciprocal reflectance, (RNIR)-1, from (R$<$)-1 made index [(R$<$)-1-(RNIR)-1] linearly proportional to the total chlorophyll content in spectral ranges $\lambda$ from 525 to 555 nm and from 695 to 725 nm with coefficient of determination r2 $\gg$ 0.94. To adjust for differences in leaf structure, the product of the latter index and NIR reflectance [(R$\lambda$)-1-(RNIR)-1]*(RNIR) was used; this further increased the accuracy of the chlorophyll estimation in the range $\lambda$ from 520 to 585 nm and from 695 to 740 nm. Two independent data sets were used to validate the developed algorithms. The root mean square error of the chlorophyll prediction did not exceed 50 $\mu$mol/m2 in leaves with total chlorophyll ranged from 1 to 830 $\mu$mol/m2.},

The position of this red-edge has been used successfully to estimate, by remote sensing, the chlorophyll content of vegetation canopies. Techniques used to estimate this red-edge position (REP) have been designed for use on small volumes of continuous spectral data rather than the large volumes of discontinuous spectral data recorded by contemporary satellite spectrometers. Also, each technique produces a different value of REP from the same spectral data and REP values are relatively insensitive to chlorophyll content at high values of chlorophyll content. This paper reports on the design and indirect evaluation of a surrogate REP index for use with spectral data recorded at the standard band settings of the Medium Resolution Imaging Spectrometer (MERIS). This index, termed the MERIS terrestrial chlorophyll index (MTCI), was evaluated using model spectra, field spectra and MERIS data. It was easy to calculate (and so can be automated), was correlated strongly with REP but unlike REP was sensitive to high values of chlorophyll content. As a result this index became an official MERIS level-2 product of the European Space Agency in March 2004. Further direct evaluation of the MTCI is proposed, using both greenhouse and field data.},

The data has been used to assist in the identification of management zones, map crop nutrient status, and detect pest infestations. However, in many of the examples cited, the correlation between a multispectral signature and the variation of interest was limited to single factor experiments (i.e., only one factor was primarily responsible for the variability in crop condition). A water by nitrogen experiment was conducted during the 1999 cotton season near Phoenix, Arizona, where one objective was to test the ability of remotely sensed data to distinguish between water and nitrogen stress. Multispectral (visible, near infrared and thermal) data were collected using a prototype sensor mounted on a linear move irrigation system. Neutron probe data were used to quantify crop water status, and petiole samples were used to},

  abstract = {Leaf chlorophyll content, a good indicator of photosynthesis activity, mutations, stress and nutritional state, is of special significance to precision agriculture. Recent studies have demonstrated the feasibility of retrieval of chlorophyll content from hyperspectral vegetation indices composed by the reflectance of specific bands. In this paper, a set of vegetation indices belonged to three classes (normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), modified simple ratio (MSR) index and the modified chlorophyll absorption ratio index (MCARI, TCARI) and the integrated forms (MCARI/OSAVI and TCARI/OSAVI)) were tested using the PROSPECT and SAIL models to explore their potentials in chlorophyll content estimation. Different bands combinations were also used to derive the modified vegetation indices. In the sensitivity study, four new formed indices (MSR[705,750], MCARI[705,750], TCARI/OSAVI[705,750] and MCARI/OSAVI[705,750]) were proved to have better linearity with chlorophyll content and resistant to leaf area index (LAI) variations by taking into account the effect of quick saturation at 670 nm with relatively low chlorophyll content. Validation study was also conducted at canopy scale using the ground truth data in the growth duration of winter wheat (chlorophyll content and reflectance data). The results showed that the integrated indices TCARI/OSAVI[705,750] and MCARI/OSAVI[705,750] are most appropriate for chlorophyll estimation with high correlation coefficients R2 of 0.8808 and 0.9406, respectively, because more disturbances such as shadow, soil reflectance and nonphotosynthetic materials are taken into account. The high correlation between the vegetation indices obtained in the developmental stages of wheat and Hyperion data (R2 of 0.6798 and 0.7618 for TCARI/OSAVI[705,750] and MCARI/OSAVI[705,750], respectively) indicated that these two integrated index can be used in practice to estimate the chlorophylls of different types of corns.},

  abstract = {Future climate conditions could potentially affect water supply and demand on water basins throughout the world but especially on snowmelt-driven agriculture oriented basins that can be found throughout central Chile. Increasing temperature and reducing precipitation will affect both the magnitude and timing of water supply this part of the world. Different adaptation strategies could be implemented to reduce the impacts of such scenarios. Some could be incorporated as planned policies decided at the basin or Water Use Organization levels. Examples include changing large scale irrigation infrastructure (reservoirs and main channels) either physically or its operation. Complementing these strategies it is reasonable to think that at a disaggregated level, farmers would also react (adapt) to these new conditions using a mix of options to either modify their patterns of consumption (irrigation efficiency, crop mix, crop area reduction), increase their ability to access new sources of water (groundwater, water markets) or finally compensate their expected losses (insurance). We present a modeling framework developed to represent these issues using as a case study the Limar{\'\i} basin located in Central Chile. This basin is a renowned example of how the development of reservoirs and irrigation infrastructure can reduce climate vulnerabilities allowing the economic development of a basin. Farmers in this basin tackle climate variability by adopting different strategies that depend first on the reservoir water volume allocation rule, on the type and size of investment they have at their farms and finally their potential access to water markets and other water supplies options. The framework developed can be used to study these strategies under current and future climate scenarios. The cornerstone of the framework is an hydrology and water resources model developed on the WEAP platform. This model is able to reproduce the large scale hydrologic features of the basin such as snowmelt hydrology, reservoir operation and groundwater dynamics. Crop yield under different water irrigation patterns have been inferred using a calibrated Cropsyst model. These crop yields together with user association irrigation constraints are used in a GAMS optimization model embedded dynamically in WEAP in order to obtain every year decisions on crop mix (including fallow land), irrigation patterns and participation in the spot water market. The GAMS optimization model has been calibrated using annual crop mix time series derived using a combination of sources of information ranging from different type of census plus satellite images. The resulting modeling platform is able to simulate under historic and future climate scenarios water availability in different locations of the basin with associated crop yield and economic consequences. The platform also allows the implementation of autonomous and planned adaptation strategies that could reduce the impacts of climate variability and climate change.},

With nearly 40years of continuous observation \textendash{} since launch of the first satellite in 1972 \textendash{} the Landsat program has benefited from insightful technical specification, robust engineering, and the necessary infrastructure for data archive and dissemination. Chiefly, the spatial and spectral resolutions have proven of broad utility and have remained largely stable over the life of the program. The foresighted acquisition and maintenance of a global image archive has proven to be of unmatched value, providing a window into the past and fueling the monitoring and modeling of global land cover and ecological change. In this paper we discuss the evolution of the Landsat program as a global monitoring mission, highlighting in particular the recent change to an open (free) data policy. The new data policy is revolutionizing the use of Landsat data, spurring the creation of robust standard products and new science and applications approaches. Open data access also promotes increased international collaboration to meet the Earth observing needs of the 21st century.},

  abstract = {We present a new binary (two-class) supervised non-parametric classification approach that is based on iterative partitioning of multidimensional feature space into variably-sized and nested hyper-cubes (partitions). The proposed method contains elements of active learning and includes classifier to analyst queries. The spectral transition zone between two thematic classes (i.e., where training labels of different classes overlap in feature space) is targeted through iterative training derivation. Three partition categories are defined: pure, indivisible and unlabeled. Pure partitions contain training labels from only one class, indivisible partitions contain training data from different classes, and unlabeled partitions do not contain training data. A minimum spectral tolerance threshold defines the smallest partition volume to avoid over-fitting. In this way the transition zones between class distributions are minimized, thereby maximizing both the spectral volume of pure partitions in the feature space and the number of pure pixels in the classified image. The classification results are displayed to show each classified pixel's partition category (pure, unlabeled and indivisible). Mapping pixels belonging to unlabeled partitions serves as a query from the classifier to the analyst, targeting spectral regions absent of training data. The classification process is repeated until significant improvement of the classification is no longer realized or when no classification errors and unlabeled pixels are left. Variably-sized partitions lead to intensive training data derivation in the spectral transition zones between the target classes. The methodology is demonstrated for surface water and permanent snow and ice classifications using 30m conterminous United States Landsat 7 Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus (ETM+) data time series from 2006 to 2010. The surface water result was compared with Shuttle Radar Topography Mission (SRTM) water body and National Land Cover Database (NLCD) open water classes with an overall agreement greater than 99\% and Kappa coefficient greater than 0.9 in both of cases. In addition, the surface water result was compared with a classification generated using the same input data and a standard bagged Classification and Regression Tree (CART) classifier. The nested segmentation and CART-generated products had an overall agreement of 99.9 and Kappa coefficient of 0.99.},

  abstract = {Winter cover crops are an essential part of managing nutrient and sediment losses from agricultural lands. Cover crops lessen sedimentation by reducing erosion, and the accumulation of nitrogen in aboveground biomass results in reduced nutrient runoff. Winter cover crops are planted in the fall and are usually terminated in early spring, making them susceptible to senescence, frost burn, and leaf yellowing due to wintertime conditions. This study sought to determine to what extent remote sensing indices are capable of accurately estimating the percent groundcover and biomass of winter cover crops, and to analyze under what critical ranges these relationships are strong and under which conditions they break down. Cover crop growth on six fields planted to barley, rye, ryegrass, triticale or wheat was measured over the 2012\textendash{}2013 winter growing season. Data collection included spectral reflectance measurements, aboveground biomass, and percent groundcover. Ten vegetation indices were evaluated using surface reflectance data from a 16-band CROPSCAN sensor. Restricting analysis to sampling dates before the onset of prolonged freezing temperatures and leaf yellowing resulted in increased estimation accuracy. There was a strong relationship between the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) and percent groundcover (r2=0.93) suggesting that date restrictions effectively eliminate yellowing vegetation from analysis. The triangular vegetation index (TVI) was most accurate in estimating high ranges of biomass (r2=0.86), while NDVI did not experience a clustering of values in the low and medium biomass ranges but saturated in the higher range ($>$1500kg/ha). The results of this study show that accounting for index saturation, senescence, and frost burn on leaves can greatly increase the accuracy of estimates of percent groundcover and biomass for winter cover crops.},

In particular, we highlight the individual and combinatorial influence of spectral and temporal components of MODIS reflectance data in land cover classification. Our study relies on an annual time series of twelve MODIS 8-days composited images (MOD09A1) monthly acquired during the year 2000, at a 500~m nominal resolution. As our aim is not to propose an operational classifier directed at thematic mapping based on the most efficient combination of reflectance inputs \textemdash{} which will probably change across geographical regions and with different land cover nomenclatures \textemdash{} we intentionally restrict our experimental framework to continental Portugal. Because our observation data stream contains highly correlated components, we need to rank the temporal and the spectral features according not only to their individual ability at separating the land cover classes, but also to their differential contribution to the existing information. To proceed, we resort to the median Mahalanobis distance as a statistical separability criterion. Once achieved this arrangement, we strive to evaluate, in a classification perspective, the gain obtained when the dimensionality of the input feature space grows. We then successively embedded the prior ranked measures into the multitemporal and multispectral training data set of a Support Vector Machines (SVM) classifier. In this way, we show that, only the inclusion of the approximately first three dates substantially increases the classification accuracy. Moreover, this multitemporal factor has a significant effect when coupled with combinations of few spectral bands, but it turns negligible as soon as the full spectral information is exploited. Regarding the multispectral factor, its beneficence on classification accuracy remains more constant, regardless of the number of dates being used.},

  abstract = {How to fully use spectral and temporal information for efficient identification of crops becomes a crucial issue since each crop has its specific seasonal dynamics. A thorough understanding on the relative usefulness of spectral and temporal features is thus essential for better organization of crop classification information. This study, taking Heilongjiang Province as the study area, aims to use time-series moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer (MODIS) surface reflectance product (MOD09A1) data to evaluate the importance of spectral and temporal features for crop classification. In doing so, a feature selection strategy based on separability index (SI) was first used to rank the most important spectro-temporal features for crop classification. Ten feature scenarios with different spectral and temporal variable combinations were then devised, which were used for crop classification using the support vector machine and their accuracies were finally assessed with the same crop samples. The results show that the normalized difference tillage index (NDTI), land surface water index (LSWI) and enhanced vegetation index (EVI) are the most informative spectral features and late August to early September is the most informative temporal window for identifying crops in Heilongjiang for the observed year 2011. Spectral diversity and time variety are both vital for crop classification, and their combined use can improve the accuracy by about 30\% in comparison with single image. The feature selection technique based on SI analysis is superior for achieving high crop classification accuracy (producers' accuracy of 94.03\% and users' accuracy of 93.77\%) with a small number of features. Increasing temporal resolution is not necessarily important for improving the classification accuracies for crops, and a relatively high classification accuracy can be achieved as long as the images associated with key phenological phrases are retained.},

The USGS took over mission operations on May 30, 2013 and renamed LCDM to Landsat 8. Access to Landsat 8 data was opened to users worldwide. Three years following launch we evaluate the science and applications impact of Landsat 8. With a mission objective to enable the detection and characterization of global land changes at a scale where differentiation between natural and human-induced causes of change is possible, LDCM promised incremental technical improvements in capabilities needed for Landsat scientific and applications investigations. Results show that with Landsat 8, we are acquiring more data than ever before, the radiometric and geometric quality of data are generally technically superior to data acquired by past Landsat missions, and the new measurements, e.g., the coastal aerosol and cirrus bands, are opening new opportunities. Collectively, these improvements are sparking the growth of science and applications opportunities. Equally important, with Landsat 7 still operational, we have returned to global imaging on an 8-day cycle, a capability that ended when Landsat 5 ceased operational Earth imaging in November 2011. As a result, the Landsat program is on secure footings and planning is underway to extend the record for another 20 or more years.},

Monitoring and mapping of land cover and land cover change in a consistent and robust manner over large areas is made possible with Earth Observation (EO) data. Land cover products satisfying a range of science and policy information needs are currently produced periodically at different spatial and temporal scales. The increased availability of EO data\textemdash{}particularly from the Landsat archive (and soon to be augmented with Sentinel-2 data)\textemdash{}coupled with improved computing and storage capacity with novel image compositing approaches, have resulted in the availability of annual, large-area, gap-free, surface reflectance data products. In turn, these data products support the development of annual land cover products that can be both informed and constrained by change detection outputs. The inclusion of time series change in the land cover mapping process provides information on class stability and informs on logical class transitions (both temporally and categorically). In this review, we present the issues and opportunities associated with generating and validating time-series informed annual, large-area, land cover products, and identify methods suited to incorporating time series information and other novel inputs for land cover characterization.},

  abstract = {The overgrowing population and the recent droughts are putting water resources under pressure and calling for new approaches for water planning and management if escalating conflicts are to be avoided and environmental degradation is to be reversed. As countries are using their water resources with growing intensity, poor rainfall increasingly leads to national water crises as water tables fall and reservoirs, wetlands and rivers empty. Global warming could cause further changes, further variability and further uncertainty. The UK Hadley Centre's global climate model was run at a spatial scale of 2$\cdot$5 by 3$\cdot$75$^\circ$ (latitude and longitude) grid squares to simulate the global climate according to scenarios of greenhouse gas concentration emission. Runs of the model assuming the emission scenario proposed by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change in 1995 are analysed here for the 2050s time horizon. Outputs provide estimations of climate variables, such as precipitation and temperature, at a monthly time step. Those results, assumed representative of future climatic conditions, are compared to mean monthly values representative of the current climate and expressed in terms of percentage change. The results show that, for the dry season (April\textendash{}September), by the 2050s, North Africa and some parts of Egypt, Saudi Arabia, Iran, Syria, Jordan and Israel, are expected to have reduced rainfall amounts of 20\textendash{}25\% less than the present mean values. This decrease in rainfall is accompanied by a temperature rise in those areas of between 2 and 2$\cdot$75$^\circ$C. For the same period, the temperature in the coastal areas of the Mediterranean countries will rise by about 1$\cdot$5$^\circ$C. In wintertime, the rainfall will decrease by about 10\textendash{}15\% but would increase over the Sahara by about 25\%. Given the low rainfall rate over the Sahara, the increase by 25\% will not bring any significant amount of rain to the region. In wintertime, the temperature in the coastal areas will also increase but by only 1$\cdot$5$^\circ$C on average, while inside the region it will increase by 1$\cdot$75\textendash{}2$\cdot$5$^\circ$C. In southern Africa (Angola, Namibia, Mozambique, Zimbabwe, Zambia, Botswana and South Africa), results suggest an increase of the annual average temperature ranging between 1$\cdot$5 and 2$\cdot$5$^\circ$C in the south to between 2$\cdot$5 and 3$^\circ$C in the north. The summer range is between 1$\cdot$75 and 2$\cdot$25$^\circ$C in the south, and increases towards the north to between 2$\cdot$75 and 3$\cdot$0$^\circ$C while the winter range is between 1$\cdot$25 and 2$^\circ$C in the south, and increases towards the north to between 2$\cdot$5 and 2$\cdot$75$^\circ$C. On the other hand, the annual average will decrease by 10\textendash{}15\% in the south and by 5\textendash{}10\% in the north. The annual average decrease is 10\%. However, some places will have an increase i.e. by 5\textendash{}20\% in South Africa in wintertime. In the Taklimakan region (Tarim Basin) west of China, the annual average temperature is shown to increase by 1$\cdot$75\textendash{}2$\cdot$5$^\circ$C. Annual average rainfall should increase by 5\textendash$>$25\% in most of the region but decrease by 5\textendash{}10\% in some small parts. In summer, an increase by 5\textendash{}15\% is indicated in most of the region, and an increase by up to 25\% or more during the wintertime. In the Thar Desert (India\textendash{}Pakistan\textendash{}Afghanistan), estimations suggest that the annual average increase in temperature ranges from 1$\cdot$75 to 2$\cdot$5$^\circ$C, ranging from 1$\cdot$5 to 2$\cdot$25$^\circ$C in winter and from 2 to 2$\cdot$5$^\circ$C in summer. Annual average precipitation is shown to decrease by 5\textendash{}25\% in the region. The winter will have values closer to the annual average but the summer will have more decrease and most of the region will see a decrease closer to 25\%. In the Aral Sea basin (Kazakhstan, Turkmenistan and Uzbekistan), estimates suggest an annual average increase in temperature ranging from 1$\cdot$75 to 2$\cdot$25$^\circ$C, higher in summer (between 2 and 2$\cdot$75$^\circ$C) than in winter (between 1$\cdot$5 and 2$^\circ$C). Rainfall should increase by 5\textendash{}20\% annually, in summer increasing by 5\textendash{}10\% in the north but decreasing by up to 5\% in the south, while in wintertime, both south and north should undergo increases of 5\textendash{}10\% and 20\textendash{}25\%, respectively. In Australia, results indicate an increase in the annual average temperature ranges of 1\textendash{}1$\cdot$5$^\circ$C in the south to 2$\cdot$5\textendash{}2$\cdot$75$^\circ$C in the north, slightly higher during the summer than in the winter. The summer range is between 1 and 2$^\circ$C in the south and increases towards the north to 2$\cdot$5\textendash{}3$\cdot$0$^\circ$C while the winter range is between 1 and 1$\cdot$5$^\circ$C in the south, and increases towards the north to between 2 and 2$\cdot$25$^\circ$C. Rainfall annual average is shown to decrease by 20\textendash{}25\% in the south and by 5\textendash{}10\% in the north. Given the above-mentioned facts, in order to meet the water demands in the next century, some dams and water infrastructure will be built in some countries and a new paradigm by rethinking the water use with the aim of increasing the productive use of water will have to be adopted. Two approaches are needed: increasing the efficiency with which current needs are met and increasing the efficiency with which water is allocated among different uses. In addition, non-conventional sources of water supply such as reclaimed, recycled water and desalinated brackish water or seawater is expected to play an important role.},

During drought plants respond physiologically and structurally to prevent excessive water loss according to species-specific water use strategies. This has consequences for carbon uptake by photosynthesis and release by total ecosystem respiration. After a drought the disturbances in the reservoirs of moisture, organic matter and nutrients in the soil and carbohydrates in plants lead to longer-term effects in plant carbon cycling, and potentially mortality. Direct and carry-over effects, mortality and consequently species competition in response to drought are strongly related to the survival strategies of species. Here we review the state of the art of the understanding of the relation between soil moisture drought and the interactions with the carbon cycle of the terrestrial ecosystems. We argue that plant strategies must be given an adequate role in global vegetation models if the effects of drought on the carbon cycle are to be described in a way that justifies the interacting processes.},

  abstract = {At present, the Standardized Precipitation Index (SPI) is the most widely used drought index to provide good estimations about the intensity, magnitude and spatial extent of droughts. The main advantage of the SPI in comparison with other indices is the fact that the SPI enables both determination of drought conditions at different time scales and monitoring of different drought types. It is widely accepted that SPI time scales affect different sub-systems in the hydrological cycle due to the fact that the response of the different water usable sources to precipitation shortages can be very different. The long time scales of SPI are related to hydrological droughts (river flows and reservoir storages). Nevertheless, few analyses empirically verify these statements or the usefulness of the SPI time scales to monitor drought. In this paper, the SPI at different time scales is compared with surface hydrological variables in a big closed basin located in the central Spanish Pyrenees. We provide evidence about the way in which the longer ($>$12~months) SPI time scales may not be useful for drought quantification in this area. In general, the surface flows respond to short SPI time scales whereas the reservoir storages respond to longer time scales (7\textendash{}10~months). Nevertheless, important seasonal differences can be identified in the SPI-usable water sources relationships. This suggests that it is necessary to test the drought indices and time scales in relation to their usefulness for monitoring different drought types under different environmental conditions and water demand situations.},

Rainwater harvesting, broadly defined as the collection and storage of surface runoff, has a long history in supplying water for agricultural purposes. Despite its significance, rainwater harvesting in small reservoirs has previously been overlooked in large-scale assessments of agricultural water supply and demand. We used a macroscale hydrological model, observed climate data and other physical datasets to explore the potential role of small, localized rainwater harvesting systems in supplying water for irrigated areas. We first estimated the potential contribution of local water harvesting to supply currently irrigated areas. We then explored the potential of supplemental irrigation applied to all cropland areas to increase crop evapotranspiration (or green water flow), using locally stored surface runoff in small reservoirs for different scenarios of installed reservoir capacity. The estimated increase in green water flow varied between 623 and 1122km3a-1. We assessed the implications of this increase in green water flows for cereal production by assuming a constant crop water productivity in areas where current levels of crop yield are below global averages. Globally, the supplemental irrigation of existing cropland areas could increase cereal production by $\sim$35\% for a medium variant of reservoir capacity, with large potential increases in Africa and Asia. As small reservoirs can significantly impact the hydrological regime of river basins, we also assessed the impacts of small reservoirs on downstream river flow and quantified evaporation losses from small reservoirs.},

  abstract = {Relatively few studies have addressed water management and adaptation measures in the face of changing water balances due to climate change. The current work studies climate change impact on a multipurpose reservoir performance and derives adaptive policies for possible future scenarios. The method developed in this work is illustrated with a case study of Hirakud reservoir on the Mahanadi river in Orissa, India, which is a multipurpose reservoir serving flood control, irrigation and power generation. Climate change effects on annual hydropower generation and four performance indices (reliability with respect to three reservoir functions, viz. hydropower, irrigation and flood control, resiliency, vulnerability and deficit ratio with respect to hydropower) are studied. Outputs from three general circulation models (GCMs) for three scenarios each are downscaled to monsoon streamflow in the Mahanadi river for two future time slices, 2045\textendash{}65 and 2075\textendash{}95. Increased irrigation demands, rule curves dictated by increased need for flood storage and downscaled projections of streamflow from the ensemble of GCMs and scenarios are used for projecting future hydrologic scenarios. It is seen that hydropower generation and reliability with respect to hydropower and irrigation are likely to show a decrease in future in most scenarios, whereas the deficit ratio and vulnerability are likely to increase as a result of climate change if the standard operating policy (SOP) using current rule curves for flood protection is employed. An optimal monthly operating policy is then derived using stochastic dynamic programming (SDP) as an adaptive policy for mitigating impacts of climate change on reservoir operation. The objective of this policy is to maximize reliabilities with respect to multiple reservoir functions of hydropower, irrigation and flood control. In variations to this adaptive policy, increasingly more weightage is given to the purpose of maximizing reliability with respect to hydropower for two extreme scenarios. It is seen that by marginally sacrificing reliability with respect to irrigation and flood control, hydropower reliability and generation can be increased for future scenarios. This suggests that reservoir rules for flood control may have to be revised in basins where climate change projects an increasing probability of droughts. However, it is also seen that power generation is unable to be restored to current levels, due in part to the large projected increases in irrigation demand. This suggests that future water balance deficits may limit the success of adaptive policy options.},

  abstract = {Droughts affect the Canadian prairies on a regular basis. The drought of 1999\textendash{}2005 was the most recent one and was the most severe on record for part of the region. It was characterized by lack of precipitation, desiccation of agricultural soils, decline in groundwater tables and depletion of surface water supplies. The effects on wetlands were particularly severe, with many wetlands completely drying out. The physically based cold regions hydrological modelling (CRHM) platform was used to analyse the impacts of this recent drought on water flow to and storage within a small Canadian prairie wetland. Model simulations were conducted for a small closed basin for the drought period of 1999\textendash{}2005 and the relatively wet period of 2005\textendash{}2006. The basin consists of a cultivated upland, draining into a glacially formed pothole depression with no outlet. The wetland fills the depression in wet years and is underlain by a heavy glacial till that impedes groundwater exchange. Results from the observations and model outputs showed that much lower precipitation and snow accumulation, shorter snow-covered duration, enhanced winter evaporation, and much lower discharge to the wetland from basin snowmelt runoff developed in the severe drought years of 1999\textendash{}2002. As a result, there were only 14$\cdot$9, 3$\cdot$7, and 14$\cdot$4 mm of snowmelt runoff for the springs of 2000, 2001, and 2002, respectively. Compared to the 68$\cdot$2 mm of melt-water discharge in the spring of 2006, discharge to the wetland was 78, 95, and 79\% less for these years. This is consistent with the observed water level in the wetland, which shows dramatic decline over this period. CRHM was used to investigate the potential impact of snow management as a tool to enhance runoff to the wetland during droughts. Model runs parameterized with suppressed vegetation in the cultivated land surrounding the wetland showed increased blowing snow transport to the wetland from an area exceeding the basin area that resulted in greater snow accumulation in and melt-water supply to the wetland.

Throughout Nevada and eastern California, snow-dominated watersheds provide most of the water supply for both human and environmental demands. Increasing demands on finite water supplies have resulted in the need to better monitor drought and its associated hydrologic and agricultural impacts. Two multiscalar drought indices, the standardized precipitation index (SPI) and the standardized precipitation evapotranspiration index (SPEI), are evaluated over Nevada and eastern California regions of the Great Basin using standardized streamflow, lake, and reservoir water surface stages to quantify wet and dry periods. Results show that both metrics are significantly correlated to surface water availability, with SPEI showing slightly higher correlations over SPI, suggesting that the inclusion of a simple term for atmospheric demand in SPEI is useful for characterizing hydrologic drought in arid regions. These results also highlight the utility of multiscalar drought indices as a proxy for summer groundwater discharge and baseflow periods.},

  abstract = {Droughts are increasing in frequency and severity in many regions of the world due to climate change. The meteorological drivers of drought often cause subsequent hydrological effects such as reduced catchment runoff, river flows and lake levels. Hydrological droughts may also result in significant changes in water quality. This review provides a synthesis of past observational research on the effects of drought on the water quality of freshwater systems (rivers, streams, lakes, reservoirs). Over the last 10\textendash{}20years there has been an increasing amount of studies on the water quality effects of drought, mostly in North America, Europe, and Australia. In general droughts, and the immediate recovery period, were found to have profound water quality effects. These effects were varied, depending on the characteristics of the water body and its catchment. Key drivers of water quality change were identified and integrated across different systems using quantitative analysis where possible. Water flow and volume decreases during drought typically led to increased salinity due to reduced dilution and concentration of mass. Temperature increases and enhanced stratification occurred during drought in some systems due to air temperature increases and longer hydraulic residence times. This also enhanced algal production, promoted toxic cyanobacterial blooms, and lowered dissolved oxygen concentrations. Nutrient, turbidity and algal levels also often increased in lake systems due to reduced flushing and enhanced productivity, and resuspension in some shallow lakes. In contrast, nutrients and turbidity often decreased during droughts in rivers and streams with no significant loading from point and agricultural non-point sources. This was due to disruption of catchment inputs and increased influence of internal processes (e.g. biological uptake of nutrients, denitrification, settling). Where point sources of pollution were present, water quality generally showed deterioration due to less dilution, particularly for nutrients. Storage and buildup of material and changed geochemistry (e.g. sulfide oxidation) in catchments during drought resulted in mobilisation of large post-drought flood loadings of constituents such as major ions, nutrients and carbon. In some cases this caused severe downstream water quality effects such as deoxygenation. Key areas for further research are process-level understanding of the key drivers of water quality change in catchments and receiving water bodies during drought, development of predictive models, and studying the resilience of systems to the predicted increase in frequency of drought and floods. The maintenance of long term water quality monitoring programmes is also critical.},

As a natural hazard, drought is best characterized by multiple climatological and hydrological parameters. An understanding of the relationships between these two sets of parameters is necessary to develop measures for mitigating the impacts of droughts. Droughts are recognized as an environmental disaster and have attracted the attention of environmentalists, ecologists, hydrologists, meteorologists, geologists, and agricultural scientists. Temperatures; high winds; low relative humidity; and timing and characteristics of rains, including distribution of rainy days during crop growing seasons, intensity, and duration of rain, and onset and termination, play a significant role in the occurrence of droughts. In contrast to aridity, which is a permanent feature of climate and is restricted to low rainfall areas, a drought is a temporary aberration. Often, there is confusion between a heat wave and a drought, and the distinction is emphasized between heat wave and drought, noting that a typical time scale associated with a heat wave is on the order of a week, while a drought may persist for months or even years. The combination of a heat wave and a drought has dire socio-economic consequences. Drought risk is a product of a region's exposure to the natural hazard and its vulnerability to extended periods of water shortage. If nations and regions are to make progress in reducing the serious consequences of drought, they must improve their understanding of the hazard and the factors that influence vulnerability. It is critical for drought-prone regions to better understand their drought climatology (i.e., the probability of drought at different levels of intensity and duration) and establish comprehensive and integrated drought information system that incorporates climate, soil, and water supply factors such as precipitation, temperature, soil moisture, snow pack, reservoir and lake levels, ground water levels, and stream flow. All drought-prone nations should develop national drought policies and preparedness plans that place emphasis on risk management rather than following the traditional approach of crisis management, where the emphasis is on reactive, emergency response measures. Crisis management decreases self-reliance and increases dependence on government and donors.},

Therefore, efforts are needed to develop a new agricultural drought index, which is based on the Variable Infiltration Capacity (VIC) model coupled with an irrigation scheme and a reservoir module. The new drought index was derived from the simulated soil moisture data from a retrospective VIC simulation from 1961 to 2007 over the irrigated area in the TRB. The physical processes in the coupled VIC model allow the new agricultural drought index to take into account a wide range of hydrologic processes including the irrigation process and reservoir operations. Notably, the irrigation process was found to dominate the surface water balance and drought evolution in the TRB. Furthermore, the drought conditions identified by the new agricultural drought index presented a good agreement with the historical drought events that occurred in 1993\textendash{}94, 2004, and 2006\textendash{}07, respectively. Moreover, the spatial distribution of coupled VIC model outputs using the new drought index provided detailed information about where and to what extent droughts occurred.},

  abstract = {[1] The ``Millennium Drought'' (2001\textendash{}2009) can be described as the worst drought on record for southeast Australia. Adaptation to future severe droughts requires insight into the drivers of the drought and its impacts. These were analyzed using climate, water, economic, and remote sensing data combined with biophysical modeling. Prevailing El Ni{\~n}o conditions explained about two thirds of rainfall deficit in east Australia. Results for south Australia were inconclusive; a contribution from global climate change remains plausible but unproven. Natural processes changed the timing and magnitude of soil moisture, streamflow, and groundwater deficits by up to several years, and caused the amplification of rainfall declines in streamflow to be greater than in normal dry years. By design, river management avoided impacts on some categories of water users, but did so by exacerbating the impacts on annual irrigation agriculture and, in particular, river ecosystems. Relative rainfall reductions were amplified 1.5\textendash{}1.7 times in dryland wheat yields, but the impact was offset by steady increases in cropping area and crop water use efficiency (perhaps partly due to CO2 fertilization). Impacts beyond the agricultural sector occurred (e.g., forestry, tourism, utilities) but were often diffuse and not well quantified. Key causative pathways from physical drought to the degradation of ecological, economic, and social health remain poorly understood and quantified. Combined with the multiple dimensions of multiyear droughts and the specter of climate change, this means future droughts may well break records in ever new ways and not necessarily be managed better than past ones.},

The study determines spatial differences in the effects of drought on the natural vegetation and agricultural crops by means of the joint use of vegetation indexes derived from AVHRR images, a drought index (standardized precipitation index), and Geographic Information Systems. The results show that the effect of drought on vegetation varies noticeably between areas, a pattern that is determined mainly by the location of land-cover types. The influence also varies each month and, in general, is higher during the spring and summer. Aridity and vegetation characteristics similarly account, in part, for spatial differences in the impact of drought on vegetation. In general, the most arid areas, where vegetation cover and activity are low, are those in which the interannual variability of vegetation activity is more determined by the drought occurrence. In assessing drought impact, this analysis takes into account the effects of drought on the vegetation and also considers spatial and seasonal differences. The results should be useful for the management of natural vegetation and crops and for the development of better drought mitigation strategies.},

It is now defined in the United Nations Convention to Combat Desertification (UNCCD) as land degradation in the drylands (land falling within arid, semi-arid and dry sub-humid areas) resulting from various factors, including climatic variations and human activities. This definition, which is now being used worldwide to describe desertification and its impacts, leads to the need to consider carefully the two-way interactions between climate and desertification. Dramatic changes in agricultural practices during the last several decades are one of the main driving forces for land degradation in the drylands and examples of land degradation are given for several regions around the world. The effects of desertification on climate have been described mainly in terms of changes in land use and land cover leading to land degradation; overgrazing; biomass burning and atmospheric emissions; agriculture's contribution to air pollution; forest and woodland clearing and accelerated wind erosion; anthropogenic land disturbances and wind erosion; and the impact of irrigated agriculture on surface conditions in drylands. It is equally important to consider the impact of dryland climates on soils and vegetation and the impact of climate change on desertification. It is important to adopt uniform criteria and methods to assess desertification and encourage monitoring of dryland degradation in all the regions around the world. To better understand the interactions between climate and desertification, it is also important to identify the sources and sinks of dryland carbon, aerosols and trace gases in drylands.},

On the other hand, human use (and abuse) of vulnerable dry land ecosystems may lead to unsustainable land management. Based on these considerations, this paper analyses the recent land cover changes observed in Latium (Italy) during the exceptionally dry period 2000\textendash{}2007. More than 50\% of the area investigated was classified as dry in 2004\textendash{}2007 compared with 0\% in 2000\textendash{}2003. Moreover, climatic aridity impacted differently on semi-natural, agricultural, and built-up land.

A Normalized Vegetation Supply Water Index (NVSWI) is devised, combining remotely sensed climate data to retrieve key drought indicators over different vegetation cover types and a lag-time relationship is established based on preceding rainfall. The results indicate that during the major drought event of spring 2010, Evergreen Forest (EF) experienced severe dry conditions for 48 days fewer than Cropland (CL) and Shrubland (SL). Testing of vegetation response to drought conditions with different lag-time periods since the last rainfall indicated a highest correlation for CL and SL with the 4th lag period (i.e., 64 days) whereas EF exhibited maximum correlation with the 5th lag period (i.e., 80 days). Evergreen Forest, which includes tree crops, appears to act as a green reservoir of water, and is more resistant than CL and SL to drought due to its water retention capacity with deeper roots to tap sub-surface water. Identifying differences in rainfall lag-time relationships among land cover types using a remote sensing-based integrated drought index enables more accurate drought prediction, and can thus assist in the development of more specific drought adaptation strategies.},

This paper uses remote sensing to assess the phenomenological impacts of two isolated droughts, distinguishing the response of different vegetation covers in semiarid developing regions where rainfed agriculture is common. Using the standardized precipitation index, one normal and two dry years were selected (2000, 2005, and 2011, respectively). An original protocol for land use land cover (LULC) classification that combines climatic, topographic, and reflectance information from 18 Landsat ETM+ images was applied to subsequently distinguish drought effects in different classes through the selected years. Finally, two vegetation indices (normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) and vegetation condition index (VCI)) were calculated to detect drought severity impacts over the different LULC classes. This approach was tested in Central Mexico and provided accurate information on the location and extent of areas affected by drought. The proposed approach can be used as a system for drought risk management in semi-arid developing regions.},

The results show declines in woody savannah and increases in barren land and swamps inside and outside Tarangire National Park and increases in woody savannah and savannah, and declines of shrubland and grassland inside and outside Katavi National Park. The decrease of woody savannah was partially due to its conversion into grassland and barren land, possibly caused by human encroachment by cultivation and livestock.

  abstract = {The Heihe River Basin (HRB) is a typical arid inland river basin in northwestern China. From the 1960s to the 1990s, the downstream flow in the HRB declined as a result of large, artificial changes in the distribution of water and land and a lack of effective water resource management. Consequently, the ecosystems of the lower reaches of the basin substantially deteriorated. To restore these degraded ecosystems, the Ecological Water Diversion Project (EWDP) was initiated by the Chinese government in 2000. The project led to agricultural and ecological changes in the middle reaches of the basin. In this study, we present three datasets of land use/cover in the middle reaches of the HRB derived from Landsat TM/ETM+ images in 2000, 2007 and 2011. We used these data to investigate changes in land use/cover between 2000 and 2011 and the implications for sustainable water resource management. The results show that the most significant land use/cover change in the middle reaches of the HRB was the continuous expansion of farmland for economic interests. From 2000 to 2011, the farmland area increased by 12.01\%. The farmland expansion increased the water resource stress; thus, groundwater was over-extracted and the ecosystem was degraded in particular areas. Both consequences are negative and potentially threaten the sustainability of the middle reaches of the HRB and the entire river basin. Local governments should therefore improve the management of water resources, particularly groundwater management, and should strictly control farmland reclamation. Then, water resources could be ecologically and socioeconomically sustained, and the balance between upstream and downstream water demands could be ensured. The results of this study can also serve as a reference for the sustainable management of water resources in other arid inland river basins.},

The study reported herein assessed the spatial and quantitative changes in surface runoff resulting from land cover change in the Al-Baha region of Saudi Arabia between 1990 and 2000 using an ArcGIS-surface runoff model and predicted land cover and surface runoff depth in 2030 using Markov chain analysis. Land cover maps for 1990 and 2000 were derived from satellite images using ArcGIS 10.1. The findings reveal a 26\% decrease in forest and shrubland area, 28\% increase in irrigated cropland, 1.5\% increase in sparsely vegetated land and 0.5\% increase in bare soil between 1990 and 2000. Overall, land cover changes resulted in a significant decrease in runoff depth values in most of the region. The decrease in surface runoff depth ranged from 25-106 mm/year in a 7020-km2 area, whereas the increase in such depth reached only 10 mm/year in a 243-km2 area. A maximum increase of 73 mm/year was seen in a limited area. The surface runoff depth decreased to the greatest extent in the central region of the study area due to the huge transition in land cover classes associated with the construction of 25 rainwater harvesting dams. The land cover prediction revealed a greater than twofold increase in irrigated cropland during the 2000-2030 period, whereas forest and shrubland are anticipated to occupy just 225 km2 of land area by 2030, a significant decrease from the 747 km2 they occupied in 2000. Overall, changes in land cover are predicted to result in an annual increase in irrigated cropland and dramatic decline in forest area in the study area over the next few decades. The increase in surface runoff depth is likely to have significant implications for irrigation activities.},

  abstract = {The Ethiopian Rift Valley is a dry land zone where for a long time pastoral communities have made their living from acacia-based woodlands. But many pastoralists have changed from a pastoral way of life to mixed farming over time. The aim of this study was to evaluate land-use and land cover (LULC) changes in the Central Rift Valley dry lands of Ethiopia, and determine the role of drought vulnerability as a driver. A combination of GIS/remote sensing techniques, drought vulnerability analyses, field observation and surveying were employed. Because drought vulnerability is linked more closely to the types of land-uses and social contexts rather than only climatological events, it was examined based on locally perceived criteria of drought. Accordingly, the pastoral way of life was vulnerable to severe drought during 25\% of the last 28years while the mixed farming (livestock and maize farming combined) system was vulnerable to severe drought only during 4\% of the years. Over the last 5 decades, cultivated lands increased to threefold while the dense acacia coverage declined from 42\% in 1965 to 9\% in 2010. The observed LULC changes were driven by the interplay of recurrent drought, socioeconomic and institutional dynamics, access to markets and improved technologies such as early-maturing maize cultivars and better land management. Proper policy and technological interventions are required to develop appropriate drought adaptation strategies and avert the increasing degradation of woodlands in the Rift Valley dry lands where a pastoral way of life is still present.},

  abstract = {Desertification is a serious global environmental problem that affects many people directly in countries with semi-arid or arid climates. The causes of desertification are diverse and complicated, ranging from international economic activities to unsustainable land use practices of local communities. The consequence of desertification reduces the ability of the land to support life and decreases biodiversity. Natural processes and artificial forces initiate this process. Natural causes of desertification include climatic factors drought, and water or wind erosion. Human induced activities that can cause desertification include over-cultivation, overgrazing, deforestation, and poor water management.The aim of this paper is to analyse how remote sensing and GIS have been used to monitor desertification globally. Remote sensing has proven to be efficient in detecting desertification processes including changes in natural vegetation, land use, and soil. Multi-temporal coverage provided by satellite data facilitates the use of remote sensing imagery to monitor changes in land coverage and usage over time. Remote sensing data and GIS are critical for extracting reliable information important for assessing environmental changes and land quality in any given region. Various techniques in remote sensing combined with analytical methods such as NDVI or classification provide primary data that can be used to assess desertification processes. Several key indicators of the processes of desertification are identified where remote sensing can be used to detect, monitor, and map affected areas. Changing vegetation and land use, drought, soil, erosion, and urbanization are the most common indicators of desertification used by researchers. Results of studies can be used to make important management, environmental, and political decisions. Therefore, care, must be taken to use recent imagery, select the appropriate technique, and to include as much additional data as possible so that reliable and robust results are obtained.},

  abstract = {Beginning with a discussion of drought definitions, this review paper attempts to provide a review of fundamental concepts of drought, classification of droughts, drought indices, and the role of remote sensing and geographic information systems for drought evaluation. Owing to the rise in water demand and looming climate change, recent years have witnessed much focus on global drought scenarios. As a natural hazard, drought is best characterized by multiple climatological and hydrological parameters. An understanding of the relationships between these two sets of parameters is necessary to develop measures for mitigating the impacts of droughts. Droughts are recognized as an environmental disaster and have attracted the attention of environmentalists, ecologists, hydrologists, meteorologists, geologists, and agricultural scientists. Temperatures; high winds; low relative humidity; and timing and characteristics of rains, including distribution of rainy days during crop growing seasons, intensity, and duration of rain, and onset and termination, play a significant role in the occurrence of droughts. In contrast to aridity, which is a permanent feature of climate and is restricted to low rainfall areas, a drought is a temporary aberration. Often, there is confusion between a heat wave and a drought, and the distinction is emphasized between heat wave and drought, noting that a typical time scale associated with a heat wave is on the order of a week, while a drought may persist for months or even years. The combination of a heat wave and a drought has dire socio-economic consequences. Drought risk is a product of a region's exposure to the natural hazard and its vulnerability to extended periods of water shortage. If nations and regions are to make progress in reducing the serious consequences of drought, they must improve their understanding of the hazard and the factors that influence vulnerability. It is critical for drought-prone regions to better understand their drought climatology (i.e., the probability of drought at different levels of intensity and duration) and establish comprehensive and integrated drought information system that incorporates climate, soil, and water supply factors such as precipitation, temperature, soil moisture, snow pack, reservoir and lake levels, ground water levels, and stream flow. All drought-prone nations should develop national drought policies and preparedness plans that place emphasis on risk management rather than following the traditional approach of crisis management, where the emphasis is on reactive, emergency response measures. Crisis management decreases self-reliance and increases dependence on government and donors.},

A differentiable approximation to the quantile regression error function is adopted so that gradient-based optimization algorithms can be used to estimate model parameters. Weight penalty and bootstrap aggregation methods are used to avoid overfitting. For convenience, functions for quantile-based probability density, cumulative distribution, and inverse cumulative distribution functions are also provided. Package functions are demonstrated on a simple precipitation downscaling task.},

In recent years, artificial intelligence techniques have gained enormous interest of many researchers in estimating of missing values. In the current study, we evaluated 11 artificial intelligence and classical techniques to determine the most suitable model for estimating of climatological data in three different climate conditions of Iran. In this case, 5 years (2001\textendash{}2005) of observed data at target and neighborhood stations were used to estimate missing data of monthly minimum temperature, maximum temperature, mean air temperature, relative humidity, wind speed and precipitation variables. The comparison includes both visual and parametric approaches using such statistic as mean absolute errors, coefficient of efficiency and skill score. In general, it was found that although the artificial intelligence techniques are more complex and time-consuming models in identifying their best structures for optimum estimation, but they outperform the classical methods in estimating missing data in three distinct climate conditions. Moreover, the in-filling done by artificial neural network rivals that by genetic programming and sometimes becomes more satisfactory, especially for precipitation data. The results also indicated that multiple regression analysis method is the suitable method among the classical methods. The results of this research proved the high importance of choosing the best and most precise method in estimating different climatological data in Iran and other arid and semi-arid regions.},

This research investigated precipitation variability across 15 stations in the Swat River basin, Pakistan, over a 51-year study period (1961\textendash{}2011). Nonparametric Mann-Kendall (MK) and Spearman's rho (SR) statistical tests were used to detect trends in monthly, seasonal, and annual precipitation, and the trend-free prewhitening approach was applied to eliminate serial correlation in the precipitation time series. The results highlighted a mix of positive (increasing) and negative (decreasing) trends in monthly, seasonal, and annual precipitation. One station in particular, the Saidu Sharif station, showed the maximum number of significant monthly precipitation events, followed by Abazai, Khairabad, and Malakand. On the seasonal time scale, precipitation trends changed from the summer to the autumn season. The Saidu Sharif station revealed the highest positive trend (7.48 mm/year) in annual precipitation. In the entire Swat River basin, statistically insignificant trends were found in the subbasins for the annual precipitation series; however, the Lower Swat subbasin showed the maximum quantitative increase in the precipitation at a rate of 2.18 mm/year. The performance of the MK and SR tests was consistent at the verified significance level.},

The results indicated that both modified methods improved the estimation of missing rainfall values at the target station based on the least error measurements. Modified normal ratio based on trimmed mean with geographical coordinate method is found to be the most appropriate method for station Batu Kurau and Sg.

  abstract = {The seasonal predictability of daily winter rainfall characteristics relevant to dry-land management was investigated in the Coquimbo region of central northern Chile, with focus on the seasonal rainfall total, daily rainfall frequency, and mean daily rainfall intensity on wet days at the station scale. Three approaches of increasing complexity were tested. First, an index of the simultaneous El Ni{\~n}o\textendash{}Southern Oscillation (ENSO) was regressed onto May\textendash{}August (MJJA) observed precipitation; this explained 32\% of station-averaged rainfall-amount variability, but performed poorly in a forecasting setting. The second approach used retrospective seasonal forecasts made with three general circulation models (GCMs) to produce downscaled seasonal rainfall statistics by means of canonical correlation analysis (CCA). In the third approach, a nonhomogeneous hidden Markov model (nHMM) driven by the GCM's seasonal forecasts was used to model stochastic daily rainfall sequences. While the CCA is used as a downscaling method for the seasonal rainfall characteristics themselves, the nHMM has the ability to simulate a large ensemble of daily rainfall sequences at each station from which the rainfall statistics were calculated. Similar cross-validated skill estimates were obtained using both the CCA and nHMM, with the highest correlations with observations found for seasonal rainfall amount and rainfall frequency (up to 0.9 at individual stations). These findings were interpreted using analyses of observed rainfall spatial coherence, and by means of synoptic rainfall states derived from the HMM. The downscaled hindcasts were then tailored to meteorological drought prediction, using the standardized precipitation index (SPI) based on seasonal values, the frequency of substantial rainfall days ($>$15 mm; FREQ15) and the daily accumulated precipitation deficit. Deterministic hindcasts of SPI showed high hit rates, with high ranked probability skill score for probabilistic hindcasts of FREQ15 obtained via the nHMM.},
